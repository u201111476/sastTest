Before you start
* If you installed Fortify SCA on Windows in the default location (\Program Files\), you might have to copy this sample to another location and 'cd' to that location so that these instructions work correctly.  Many versions of Windows do not allow non-administrators to modify or create files under \Program Files\.

* You must have either the gcc or the cl compiler installed on your
system to analyze this sample.

Perform the following commands to run Fortify Static Code Analyzer on sample.cpp:

$ sourceanalyzer -b sample-cpp -clean

$ sourceanalyzer -b sample-cpp g++ sample.cpp
 - or -
$ sourceanalyzer -b sample-cpp cl /EHsc sample.cpp

$ sourceanalyzer -b sample-cpp -scan -f sample.fpr

Open the analysis results (FPR) in Audit Workbench:

$ auditworkbench sample.fpr

This sample demonstrates a simple dataflow vulnerability in C++ code. The
code in sample.cpp is intended to be a simple shell program; it reads
user input, checks that the user is running a safe program, and runs
that program. However, if a user specified a command such as
"safe_program ; dangerous_program", then the system() call would 
execute the dangerous program. Fortify analysis results should contain
vulnerabilities in the following categories:

      Command Injection
      Memory Leak

The Fortify analysis might discover other vulnerabilities 
depending on the Rulepack version used in the scan.

The Command Injection vulnerability indicates that user input comes
from a call to getline() on line 16 and is then passed to argument
0 of the system() call on line 21. This is due to the absence of appropriate
input length checks.
